** What is it?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: what-is-it
   :END:

This package turns bibtex-completion functions into completing-read-based Emacs commands.
When used with selectrum, embark, and marginalia, it provides similar functionality to helm-bibtex and ivy-bibtex: quick filtering and selecting of bibliographic entries from the minibuffer, and the option to run different commands against them.

Here's a screenshot with [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][vertico]], [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark/][embark]]. and =consult-completing-read-multiple=.

** Installation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: installation
   :END:

Bibtex-actions is available for installation from [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]].

In addition, the following packages are strongly recommended for the best experience.

1. [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][Vertico]] or [[https://github.ccm/raxod502/selectrum][Selectrum]] (completion interface)
2. [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][Orderless]] (completion style)
3. [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][Embark]] (contextual actions)
4. [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia][Marginalia]] (annotations, and also candidate classification for Embark)
4. [[https://github.com/minad/consult][Consult]] (enhanced interface for multiple candidate selection)

** Configuration
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: configuration
   :END:

*** Basic
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: basic
    :END:

This is the minimal configuration, and will work with any completing-read compliant vertical completion UI, like Vertico, Selectrum, or the built-in icomplete-vertical, with actions available via =M-x= commands.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package bibtex-actions
  :bind (("C-c b" . bibtex-actions-insert-citation)
         :map minibuffer-local-map
         ("M-b" . bibtex-actions-insert-preset))
  :config
  ;; make sure to set this to ensure open commands work correctly
  (bibtex-completion-additional-search-fields '(doi url))
  (bibtex-completion-bibliography '("~/bib/references.bib")))
#+END_SRC

Since most of the command logic resides in bibtex-completion, that is where to look for different [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex#basic-configuration-recommended][configuration options]].

*** Embark

Highly recommended, this option adds embark, for contextual access to actions in the minibuffer and at-point.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package bibtex-actions
  :bind (("C-c b" . bibtex-actions-insert-citation)
         :map minibuffer-local-map
         ("M-b" . bibtex-actions-insert-preset))
  :after embark
  :config
  ;; Make the 'bibtex-actions' bindings and targets available to `embark'.
  (add-to-list 'embark-target-finders 'bibtex-actions-citation-key-at-point)
  (add-to-list 'embark-keymap-alist '(bibtex . bibtex-actions-map))
  (add-to-list 'embark-keymap-alist '(citation . bibtex-actions-buffer-map))
  ;; Make sure to set this to ensure 'bibtex-actions-open-link' command works correctly.
  (bibtex-completion-additional-search-fields '(doi url))
  (bibtex-completion-bibliography '("~/bib/references.bib")))

;; use consult-completing-read for enhanced interface
(advice-add #'completing-read-multiple :override #'consult-completing-read-multiple)
#+END_SRC

When using this option, these actions are generic, and work the same across org, markdown, and latex modes.

*** Org-Cite

#+CAPTION: org-cite at-point integration with =embark-act=
[[file:images/org-cite-embark-point.png]]

If you use org-mode, this is the best option.
It includes the embark functionality above, but customizes menus and user-experience for org-cite.
In other supported modes, it will work the same as the embark option above.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Set bibliography paths so they are the same.
(my/bibs '("~/bib/references.bib"))

(use-package bibtex-actions-org-cite
  :bind (("C-c b" . org-cite-insert)
         ("M-o" . org-open-at-point)
         :map minibuffer-local-map
         ("M-b" . bibtex-actions-insert-preset))
  :after (embark org oc bibtex-actions)
  :config
  ;; make sure to set this to ensure open commands work correctly
  (bibtex-completion-additional-search-fields '(doi url))
  (bibtex-completion-bibliography my/bibs)
  (org-cite-global-bibliography my/bibs))

;; Use consult-completing-read for enhanced interface.
(advice-add #'completing-read-multiple :override #'consult-completing-read-multiple)

;; If you use which-key, want to move the Embark actions behind a submenu, and sort
;; based on the description.
(setq embark-general-map `(keymap (?G . ,embark-general-map)))
(define-key bibtex-actions-org-cite-map "G" '("general actions >" . (embark-general-map)))
(setq which-key-sort-order 'which-key-description-order)
#+END_SRC

If you prefer to have the embark menu open with =org-open-at-point=, you can set this variable.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq bibtex-actions-at-point-function 'embark-act)
#+END_SRC

You can invoke both =embark-act= and =embark-dwim=, however, independently of =org-at-point=, and in other modes such as =latex-mode=.

** Test Script
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: test-script
    :END:

The repository =test= directory also includes a script you can use to run this and associated packages in the =emacs -Q= sandbox.
To do that, simply run =./run.sh= from the =test= directory.
By default, this will use selectrum as the completion system.
If you would like to try vertico instead, just do =M-x vertico-mode=.

** Rich UI
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: rich-ui
    :END:

There are three sections of the browsing UI.

1. The prefix, exploiting the affixation feature only available starting with Emacs 28, and holding the symbols to indicate the presence of PDFs or notes associated with the entries.
2. The main display, which by default shows author, title, and date.
3. The suffix, which by default shows citekey, reference type, and (if present) tags or keywords.

You can search against all of the above content.
For the prefix, you can filter for associated PDFs or notes using =has:pdf= or =has:note= respectively (and at least with my setup, even the =:p= or =:n= shorthand).

#+CAPTION: UI sections
[[file:images/ui-segments.png]]

You can configure both of the last two just as you do with bibtex-completion.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq bibtex-actions-template '((t . " ${title:*}")))
  (setq bibtex-actions-template-suffix '((t . "          ${=key=:15}")))
#+END_SRC

Note: the asterisk signals to the formatter to use available space for the column.
You should only use this on one field total, across the two templates, for the formatting to work correctly.

By default, this UI is plain text, but you can configure it to use icons instead.

#+CAPTION: rich UI with icons screenshot
[[file:images/rich-ui-icons.png]]

Here's how to configure it to use =all-the-icons=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq bibtex-actions-symbols
    `((pdf . (,(all-the-icons-icon-for-file "foo.pdf" :face 'all-the-icons-dred) .
              ,(all-the-icons-icon-for-file "foo.pdf" :face 'bibtex-actions-icon-dim)))
      (note . (,(all-the-icons-icon-for-file "foo.txt") .
              ,(all-the-icons-icon-for-file "foo.txt" :face 'bibtex-actions-icon-dim)))        
      (link . 
          (,(all-the-icons-faicon "external-link-square" :v-adjust 0.02 :face 'all-the-icons-dpurple) .
          ,(all-the-icons-faicon "external-link-square" :v-adjust 0.02 :face 'bibtex-actions-icon-dim)))))
  ;; Here we define a face to dim non 'active' icons, but preserve alignment
  (defface bibtex-actions-icon-dim
      '((((background dark)) :foreground "#282c34")
       (((background light)) :foreground "#fafafa"))
       "Face for obscuring/dimming icons"
       :group 'all-the-icons-faces)
#+END_SRC

** History and predefined searches
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: history-and-predefined-searches
    :END:

=Bibtex-actions= has functionality similar to the [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex#p][predefined search]] functionality in =helm-bibtex= and =ivy-bibtex=, but with a different implementation.
Rather than create a new command with the search terms as argument, you just set the =bibtex-actions-presets= variable, and add the strings you want to access:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq bibtex-actions-presets '("one search string" "another search string"))
#+end_src

You then have two ways to access these strings from the completion prompt:

1. by using =M-n= from the prompt, which will cycle through the strings
2. by calling =bibtex-actions-insert-preset= with a keybinding, and then selecting the string

=Bibtex-actions= also preserves the history of your selections (see caveat below about multiple candidate selection though), which are also accessible in your completion UI, but by using =M-p=.
You can save this history across sessions by adding =bibtex-actions-history= to =savehist-additional-variables=.

** Pre-filtering entries
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: prefiltering-entries
    :END:

By default, =bibtex-actions= will, assuming you are using =orderless= or =prescient= to filter candidates, pre-filter entries for the following commands.

1. =bibtex-actions-open=: pre-narrows the list to those which have associated pdf or links
2. =bibtex-actions-open-link=: pre-narrows the list to those which have associated links
3. =bibtex-actions-open-pdf=: -pre-narrows the list to those which have associated pdf(s)

That is, upon running the command, an =initial-input= value will be inserted to narrow the results. 
You can also delete that if you prefer to see the full list of candidates.

By default, pre-filtering of =bibtex-actions-open-notes= is off, because the command by default will create a new note if none is available, and therefore it makes sense to have access to your full library. 
But you can customize this to pre-filter if you prefer.

If you want to modify those values, or remove them entirely, you can set =bibtex-actions-initial-inputs= like so; in this case turning off pre-filtering for =bibtex-actions-open-pdf=:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq bibtex-actions-initial-inputs
  '((pdf    . nil)
    (note   . nil)
    (link   . "has:link")
    (source . "has:link\\|has:pdf"))
#+end_src

** Refreshing the library display
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: refreshing-the-library-display
    :END:

Bibtex-actions uses a cache to speed up library display.
This is great for performance, but means the data can become stale if you modify it.

The =bibtex-actions-refresh= command will reload the cache, and you can call this manually. 
You can also call any of the =bibtex-actions= commands with a prefix argument: =C-u M-x bibtex-actions-insert-key=.

Finally, another option is to add =bibtex-completion=-style proactive loading externally by using =filenotify= something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Of course, you could also use `bibtex-completion-bibliography` here, but would need 
  ;; to adapt this if you specify multiple files.
  (file-notify-add-watch 
    "/path/to/file.bib" '(change) 'bibtex-actions-refresh)
#+END_SRC

You can also extend this to do the same thing for your PDF files, or notes:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (file-notify-add-watch 
    bibtex-completion-library-path '(change) 'bibtex-actions-refresh)

  (file-notify-add-watch 
    bibtex-completion-note-path '(change) 'bibtex-actions-refresh)
#+END_SRC

For additional configuration options on this, see [[https://github.com/bdarcus/bibtex-actions/wiki/Configuration#automating-path-watches][the wiki]].

** Finding citation keys at point
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: finding-citation-keys-at-point
    :END:

=bibtex-actions-at-point= can find citation keys at point in org-mode buffer, latex-mode buffer, etc. To add support for other major modes or citation syntax, you can write a function (below is an example for =org-cite=) and add it to =bibtex-completion-key-at-point-functions=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun bibtex-actions-get-key-org-cite ()
  "Return key at point for org-cite citation-reference."
  (when-let (((eq major-mode 'org-mode))
             (elt (org-element-context)))
    (pcase (org-element-type elt)
      ('citation-reference
       (org-element-property :key elt))
      ('citation
       (org-cite-get-references elt t)))))
#+end_src

** Usage
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: usage
   :END:

You have a few different ways to interact with these commands.

*** Org-cite

Bibtex-actions includes org-cite integration in =bibtex-actions-org-cite=, which includes a processor with "follow" and "insert" capabilities.

The "insert processor" will use =bibtex-actions-read= to browse your library to insert and edit citations and citation references using the =org-cite-insert= command.

The "follow processor" provides at-point functionality accessible via the =org-open-at-point= command.
By default, in org-mode with org-cite support, when point is on a citation or citation-reference, and you invoke =org-open-at-point=, it will run the default command, which is =bibtex-actions-open=.


*** =M-x=
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: m-x
    :END:

Simply do =M-x= and select the command that you want, enter the terms to find the item you are looking for, and hit return.
This runs the default action: the command you invoked.

Here's the view, using marginalia for annotations.

#+CAPTION: commands available from M-x
[[file:images/m-x.png]]

A note on multiple candidate selection:

These commands do allow you to select multiple items, with two caveats:

1. For this to work correctly, you /must/ use the ampersand (=&=) as =crm-separator= to separate the candidates.
2. We use long candidate strings, so if you use a completion system that requires you to =TAB=-complete, the experience is less-than-ideal.

*** Access an alternate action via =embark-act=
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: access-an-alternate-action-via-embark-act
    :END:

If while browsing you instead would rather edit that record, and you have embark installed and configured, this is where =embark-act= comes in.
Simply input the keybinding for =embark-act= (in my case =C-o=), and select the alternate action.

*** Use =embark-collect-snapshot=
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: use-embark-collect-snapshot
    :END:

A final option, that can be useful: run =embark-collect-snapshot= (=S=) from =embark-act=.
This will select the candidate subset, and open it in a separate buffer.
From there, you can run the same options discussed above using =embark-act= (which is also bound to =a= in the collect buffer).

So, for example, say you are working on a paper. You hold the complete super-set of items you are interested in citing at some point in that buffer.
From there, you can run different actions on the candidates at will, rather than search individually for each item you want to cite.

*** Use =bibtex-actions-dwim=
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: use-bibtex-actions-dwim
    :END:

=M-x bibtex-actions-dwim= will run the default action on citation keys found at point directly.
If you have =embark= installed, you use can =embark-dwim= instead for the same behavior, and =embark-act= for additional actions at-point.

If no citation key is found, the minibuffer will open for selection.
You can disable this behavior by setting =bibtex-actions-at-point-fallback= to nil.

** Comparisons
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: comparisons
   :END:

This is inspired by =helm-bibtex= and =ivy-bibtex=, but is based on =completing-read=.
In comparison:

- like =helm-bibtex=, but unlike =ivy-bibtex=, =bibtex-actions= has support for multi-selection of candidates
- =helm-bibtex= and =ivy-bibtex= provide a single command, and the actions accessed from there; =bibtex-actions= provides all of its actions as standard commands, available from =M-x=, without a single entry point.
- =bibtex-actions= is based on =completing-read-multiple=, with a single dependency, and works with different completion systems (though in practice is best supported in =selectrum=) and supporting packages that are =completing-read= compliant; =helm-bibtex= and =ivy-bibtex= are based on =helm= and =ivy= respectively.

** Acknowledgements
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: acknowledgements
   :END:

The ideas in this project were initially worked out in a [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex/issues/353][conversation]] with [[https://github.com/mtreca][Maxime Tréca]] and [[https://github.com/minad][Daniel Mendler]]. Daniel, author of [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]] and [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia][marginalia]], helped us understand the possibilities of the new suite of completing-read packages, while Maxime came up with an [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex/pull/355][initial prototype]].

This code takes those ideas and re-implements them to fill out the feature set, and also optimize the code clarity and performance.

Along the way, [[https://github.com/clemera][Clemens Radermacher]] and [[https://github.com/oantolin][Omar Antolín]] helped with some of the intricacies of completing-read and elisp.

And, of course, thanks to [[https://github.com/tmalsburg][Titus von der Malburg]] for creating and maintaining =bibtex-completion= and =helm-bibtex= and =ivy-bibtex=.
